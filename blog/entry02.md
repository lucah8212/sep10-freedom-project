## What I've found 

I am very glad with my topic that I have chose. I've always had an interest in Aviation, with one of my dream jobs of becoming a pilot. Although I find myself very knowledgable on Aviation, I still have found several extraordinary findings throughout my research. Reading about aviation incidents helps me and other people get an understanding of the mechanical and digital parts, and how aviation becomes even safer. (hardware, software) For example, [TWA Flight 514](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_514#) was a flight that crashed into terrain after a miscommunication between the pilots and the ATC on an approach altitude. Because of this, the GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System) was mandated to be installed on all aircraft, which alerts crew of terrain and unsafe bank angles. Accidents like these is unfortunately the reason that flying is safer than ever today.
