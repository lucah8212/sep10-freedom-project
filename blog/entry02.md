## What I've found 

I am very glad with my topic that I have chose. I've always had an interest in Aviation, with one of my dream jobs of becoming a pilot. Although I find myself very knowledgable on Aviation, I still have found several extraordinary findings throughout my research. Reading about aviation incidents helps me and other people get an understanding of the mechanical and digital parts. (hardware, software)
