# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Aviation)

## Choosing a Topic

The topic that I have chose for the Freedom Project is Aviation. I decided on Aviation because I have always had a soft spot for planes since I was about 7, and I still am today. I play a flight simulator called Infinite Flight almost daily and have about 98 flying hours. Besides that fact, I was also interested in two other topics, being Sports and Graphic Design. Since I was 100% sure that Aviation would be my topic, not as much research was put into the other topics. Some sources that I discovered about Aviation included  ["Top 5 Technological Trends to Watch in 2024"](https://baatraining.com/blog/5-top-technology-trends-in-aviation-industry/), which was published by BAA Training, and also ["Future of Aviation"](https://www.icao.int/Meetings/FutureOfAviation/Pages/default.aspx), written by ICAO, which is very significant given that ICAO is a UN specialized agency. The source that stuck out to me the most was ["Technology"](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology), which is an informational page from the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration (the most important people in Aviation.) I found the piece written by the FAA the most informative due to the fact it is published by the U.S. Government themselves, and also gives external links to 15+ plus programs that the FAA is currently working on, such as Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) & Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X), which are all advancements in technology.

## EDP

Currently, I stand on the Step 1 part of EDP, which is to define what your project will be about, and Step 2 part of EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is to research what you are most passionate about. Although I do have several articles listed above, more research will be required due to the lack of resources I currently have.

## Skills

The first skill I have learned along this part of the journey was **How to search for something specifically**. This is true because on my initial research, I was just looking up Aviation, and stumbled accross articles that would be irrelevant to the freedom project, such as one being "The Day in the Life of a Pilot", which is not really essential to technology research. Adding words like "advancements" and "tech" to my search helped me find relevant articles that I could use in my research.

The second skill that I learned was **How to take Notes**. The reason I am saying this is because I jotted down the pieces of information and links that I discovered on my research, and added it to my SEP10 Notes. Before this, I would have not recorded the websites on my notes so that way I could use them later when I start to develop my project.

## Summary

So there it is, I have begun my Freedom Project by finding useful resources on the internet about the Technology in Aviation.
