## Follow-Up, A-Frame

The last entry that was posted on this blog was Entry 4, and we went over the LOYO (Learn On Your Own) aspect of the Freedom Project. I talked about how I chose my tool A-Frame, with the intention of designing virtual cockpit by learning about how A-Frame works and testing things out, slowly making my way to the design of a virtual cockpit. Now, this did not go as planned as I did not think about the complexity of designing a virtual cockpit. Along with this, and procrastination, I changed my invention to the [PilotVision Glasses](lucah8212.github.io/sep10-freedom-project), which are holographic glasses that assist pilots by displaying important information right in front of your eyes. 

## How I made my MVP

Now, if we're being honest, my MVP wasn't done until the day before presentations, which was May 15th. The MVP was supposed to be done 2 weeks before, and this is due to my laziness of not completing my work when Mr. Mueller gave us time to work in class. I learned the hard way. Anyways - my MVP was made in a way where I focused on presenting my invention first on my website, so this meant spending more time focusing on my Part B section of the website, which included the description of my product, and most importantly the A-Frame scene.
