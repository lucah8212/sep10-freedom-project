## End of Freedom Project

Finally, we have reached the end of the SEP10 Freedom Project. Me and my class came a long way, working on this since the first month of the school year, dedicating plenty of research just based off something that interests us. This project was not easy and I hit several roadblocks along the way, but having the privilege to give a smooth presentation in front of my class was the most important thing about this project. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to present in front of more people at the SEP10 Expo, because I was sick that day. This was a bummer, because I had a great speech prepared, and had potential to be chosen for the showcase.

## Takeaways from in-class presentation

Presenting in front of my class was fairly easy for me, as I have learned how to speak to an audience well, which I know some people struggle with. It was killing me though, waiting to present the whole time because I was really excited to show off my product to my class, along with giving a clean presentation, in which I ended up going last which was quite funny. There are three takeaways that I have from presenting to my class.

* **Practice your presentation**
* **We're improving, never degrading**
* **Eye contact is key**

So first off, practice your presentation. I went into the presentations thinking I wouldn't have to prepare and practice because I knew so much about my Product and the things that we needed to give in a presentation. I ended up being wrong, and this was the reason I didn't get a 10 on my presentation grade and ended up with a 9.5. Part of the presentation was showing the responsiveness of your website, which was one of the most important things about our website, because all of Unit 3 is on responsive web design. I ended up forgetting to do this when I was showing my website, and ended up showing it after my takeways, which is why I got .5 taken off, because it was kind of out of order. I should have planned the order of how I was going to show stuff off instead of just going with the flow, which still worked, but ended up with those points docked.

Secondly, presentations are supposed to help you improve. Giving a small presentation in front of people that are familiar to you in a small room may seem like a big deal, but it's really not. Any errors that me or my classmates made during their presentations are things to reflect on, not lose sleep over. Learning how my presentations could be better from Mr. Mueller or peer feedback is very helpful for future presentations, which would probably be to more people, for an actual job. 

Lastly, staying engaged with your audience and looking at them is probably the most important thing in your presentation. I did this with my audience which made it feel more authentic, like I was trying to tell them something straight from the bottom of my heart, and not from a smartboard. Although some of my classmates did this in their presentations, most of the presenters did not look at me or a majority of the audience when giving the presentations, which made me feel partially disconnected.

## What could have been the Expo

It is really a shame that I ended up getting sick the day of the expo, because I wanted to show people what I worked on the whole year. I had a good pitch planned that was quick and short and would have captivated my audience. Here is the link to my pitch, along with my year-long notes.

## Engineering Design Process

It is safe to say that this is the last step of the EDP, which is Step 8, communicate the results. This is quite obvious because giving my presentation is communicating my results, which is my product. The Enginnering Design Process will be something I use in the future if I encounter a task that involves engineering.

## Skills

The first skill that I learned at this point was **How to give a hook**. When Mr. Mueller briefed the class on the presentation and gave us an example presentation, I realized that we can quite literally say anything that we want at the beginning of our presentation, as long as it connects to the slides. This was super useful in creating my hook, which was "Do you ever wish you were walking somewhere and life in front of you was a GPS?", and it connected to my product because the PilotVision Glasses allow pilots to see the world in front of them like a gps.

The second skill that I learned at this point in the FP was **How to be simple**. In the past, most of my slides for my presentations have filled up the space with big blocks of text, and learning how to keep it simple and use images, icons, and short bullet points as keys for my presentation was a great skill to learn.
