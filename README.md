# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Luca**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Aviation**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-Frame** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* My invention, the **PilotVision Glasses**, assists pilots by displaying important information in front of their eyes, leading to less stress in a flying enviornment
* Website is minimal and doesn't present the viewer with too much information, keeping it simple.
  
##### CONS
* The glasses could replace some important things in the cockpit that were developed by human beings, with jobs, such as the Heads-Up Display.
* The glasses also have a Built-In Assistant, meaning the need for more than 2 pilots in a cockpit is uneccesary.
