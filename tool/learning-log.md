## Tool: **Aframe**

### 3/9/25:
* I learned how to insert a Skybox
  * I can use `a-sky` to create a skybox for the virtual world
  * I downloaded a skybox from [Freepik](freepik.com) and added the file to the repository
  * I was able to get the skybox to work by doing the below
````bash
<a-sky src="sunset-lonely-street.jpg">
````
I learned how to this by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfsx9V8tIYE), which showed me to search for a skybox and then use the `a-sky` element to insert it into the scene.
