Topic: Aviation & Aerospace

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Airplanes and aerospace can be debated as one of the most important inventions ever in human history.
* Aviation allows citizens to travel to other parts of the world that they would not be able to go to without it.
* Aviation is also key for warfare, where pilots in war need to travel as quickly as they can.


## Part A: existing technology
* Piloting apps and software
  * ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, Station Weather
  * All three apps serve the main purpose of navigation for pilots, along with weather briefings and a variety of charts,
    and revolve around oneâ€™s general flight and give critical assistance to how one will pilot their plane.
  * Real-time charts are even more helpful for pilots during departure and arrival stages of the flights
* Flight computer
  * Performs critical aviation computations, including time, speed, distance, heading, wind, fuel, altitude, and more.
  * Integrated calculator to solve multiple flight-related problems in a single function.

## Part B: possible future technology
* PilotVision Glasses
  * Scientifically engineered holographic lenses focusing on providing an advanced flying experience
  * Holographic lenses highlight nearby aircraft and displays their altitude, heading, speed
  * View upcoming waypoints and altitude minimums virtually, which is helpful for Approch/Departure procedures.
  * Concept based on Tony Stark's "Jarvis", where there is also an assistant built into the glasses; you see the outside world but with extra features, such as being able to pull up a chart and read it, virtually.
