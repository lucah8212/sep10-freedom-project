# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* ask the reader a question: when you are enroute somewhere, have you ever wished you could view the world in front of you like a gps?

## Product
* a-frame embed (if thats possible. if not, then a photo of the a-frame embed.) that gives a visual of the glasses

## Process
* Code snippets that display
  * how you're able to move around in my a-frame scene
  * how my accordion for part a info stays open
* Verbal description of how I gathered knowledge
  * thumbnails of 2 youtube videos I watched, brief bullet point list of what each video told me
  * bootstrap & a-frame documents
* Wireframes

## Conclusion
* url to the project
* takeaways
  1. Stay up to date with the class: Falling behind in the Freedom Project proposed a major challenge for me, where I didn't submit an MVP on time because I didn't do my Part B in S1 and was unable to recieve peer feedback.
  2. Focus on the content first: Spend less time worrying about the specific deign of something, such as designing a clean navbar, and focus on getting content onto the webpage first.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
